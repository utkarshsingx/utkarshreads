We grow up on stories that promise love will fix everything.  
Find the right person, and the pain will fade.  

But here’s the part they don’t print in fairy tales:  
you can be deeply loved and still feel empty.  

Because love doesn’t erase childhood wounds.  
It doesn’t pay bills.  
It doesn’t make you like yourself.  

Sometimes love is real, strong, breathtaking—  
and it still isn’t enough to save you from yourself.  

That doesn’t mean the love is worthless.  
It just means healing isn’t outsourced.  
It’s brutal, lonely work you can’t hand to someone else.
