You don’t post the nights you eat peanut butter out of the jar because washing dishes feels impossible.  

You don’t post the text you typed out—  
“I miss you”—  
and deleted because you already knew the silence that would follow.  

You don’t post the moment you realized your “friends” only call when they need something.  

Instead, you post the latte art.  
The sunset.  
The curated smile.  

But the truth is: most of life doesn’t look good on camera.  
It looks like survival.  
And survival isn’t aesthetic.
