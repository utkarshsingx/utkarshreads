Some people inherit houses.  
Jewelry.  
Bank accounts.  

Others inherit rage.  
Addiction.  
Silence.  

You don’t realize it at first.  
You just think you’re “bad with emotions”  
or “have trouble trusting people.”  

But then you notice—  
your father flinched the same way you do.  
Your mother shut down the same way you do.  

It’s not just DNA we carry.  
It’s unfinished battles.  
And it’s on us to decide whether we pass them forward  
or finally let them end.
