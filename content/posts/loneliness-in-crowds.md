There’s a loneliness that’s worse than being alone—  
it’s being in a room full of people and realizing nobody actually knows you.  

You laugh at the right times.  
Nod when the stories circle around.  
Smile so nobody asks questions.  

And the whole time you’re screaming quietly:  
*If I disappeared tomorrow, would anyone notice the details that made me, me?*  

This is the loneliness nobody talks about.  
The one that follows you into crowded bars, offices, even family dinners.  
Not the absence of people,  
but the absence of being understood.
