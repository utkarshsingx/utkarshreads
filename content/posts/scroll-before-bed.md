You’re not scrolling TikTok at 1:47 a.m. because the videos are good.  
You’re scrolling because turning off the phone means being left alone with yourself.  

That’s the part nobody says out loud.  
We call it “doomscrolling,” like it’s funny,  
but it’s just avoidance wrapped in pixels.  

Because silence gets loud at night.  
The stuff you ignore in daylight—  
the regret, the shame, the faces of people you hurt—  
it all crawls out when the room goes dark.  

So you keep scrolling,  
as if endless content can muffle your own brain.
