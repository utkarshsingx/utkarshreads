There are letters I will never send.  
They live in drawers, notebooks,  
and the back corners of my heart.  

They are raw. Too raw.  
They hold the truths I was too fragile to deliver,  
and the apologies that came too late.  

And yetâ€”  
these unsent words shaped me.  
They remind me that silence  
is not always absence.  
Sometimes silence is protection.  
Sometimes silence is survival.  
Sometimes silence is love  
in its most brutal form.
