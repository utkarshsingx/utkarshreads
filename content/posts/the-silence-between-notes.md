Music is not made of notes.  
It is made of the silence between them.  

In the same way, our lives are not the endless noise of doing,  
but the pauses where we allow ourselves to feel.  

The world teaches us to fill every gap,  
to drown out silence with progress,  
but growth happens in the spaces we resist.  

Breathe.  
Wait.  
Let the pause change you.
