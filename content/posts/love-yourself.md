# Love Yourself

Loving yourself is not about ego or arrogance—it’s about building a steady relationship with the one person you’ll spend your entire life with: you.

## The Myth of Self-Criticism as Motivation

Many of us believe that being hard on ourselves will push us to improve. In reality, relentless self-criticism often drains energy, reduces confidence, and keeps us stuck in cycles of shame.

## The Power of Self-Compassion

Self-love doesn’t mean ignoring your flaws—it means approaching them with kindness, patience, and a commitment to growth. When you offer yourself compassion, you create space for real change.

### Questions to Ask Yourself

- How do I speak to myself when I make a mistake?
- Would I say those same words to a close friend?
- What small act of kindness can I offer myself today?

## The Practice

Try this: At the end of each day, write down one thing you appreciate about yourself. It doesn’t have to be big—it could be as simple as “I showed up even though I was tired.” Over time, this practice rewires how you see yourself.

## Conclusion

Loving yourself is not selfish—it’s essential. From that foundation, you can extend more authentic love, patience, and care to the world around you.
