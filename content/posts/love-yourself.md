Loving yourself is not about ego or arrogance—it’s about building a steady relationship with the one person you’ll spend your entire life with: you.

Many of us believe that being hard on ourselves will push us to improve. In reality, relentless self-criticism often drains energy, reduces confidence, and keeps us stuck in cycles of shame.

Self-love doesn’t mean ignoring your flaws—it means approaching them with kindness, patience, and a commitment to growth. When you offer yourself compassion, you create space for real change.

Try this: At the end of each day, write down one thing you appreciate about yourself. It doesn’t have to be big—it could be as simple as “I showed up even though I was tired.” Over time, this practice rewires how you see yourself. I have been using Finch for like a year now, and I'll tell you, it will work as it was supposed to be working if you use it wisely.

Loving yourself is not selfish—it’s essential. From that foundation, you can extend more authentic love, patience, and care to the world around you.
