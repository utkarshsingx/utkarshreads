You know better.  
Your friends tell you better.  
You’ve read the articles, highlighted the red flags,  
sworn “never again.”  

And then one text comes through:  
“I miss you.”  
And suddenly your body betrays you—  
fingers typing back before your brain has a chance to scream.  

We love people who don’t deserve it  
because love isn’t rational.  
It’s chemical.  
It’s muscle memory.  
It’s addiction in disguise.  

Nobody wants to admit this—  
but sometimes knowing your worth  
isn’t enough to stop you from walking back into the fire.
