People imagine suicidal thoughts as constant drama.  
But sometimes it’s quiet.  
Sometimes it’s just:  
*What if I didn’t have to do this anymore?*  

Not death itself—  
but a break.  
From bills.  
From fake smiles at work.  
From carrying grief like a backpack you can’t take off.  

We don’t say this out loud because it scares people.  
But here’s the thing:  
thinking it doesn’t make you broken.  
It makes you tired.  
And tired can heal—if you let yourself rest  
instead of pretending you’re fine.
