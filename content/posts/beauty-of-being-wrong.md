We are conditioned to treat being wrong as a weakness, something to avoid at all costs. But what if being wrong is one of the most powerful tools for growth we have?

Every time we're wrong, the universe hands us a secret: a new way of seeing. It's a crack in the wall of certainty, and through it, new light spills in.

Think of the last time you realized you were wrong about something meaningful. It probably stung. But beneath the sting, there was freedom. Freedom to change, to adapt, to expand your sense of the possible.

When we cling to being right, we cling to a version of ourselves that has already stopped growing. When we allow ourselves to be wrong, we step into curiosity, humility, and discovery.

Being wrong is not the opposite of learning. It's the doorway to it.
