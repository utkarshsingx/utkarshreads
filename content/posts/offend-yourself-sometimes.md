# Offend Yourself Sometimes

Growth often requires us to challenge our most fundamental assumptions about ourselves and the world around us.

## The Comfort of Certainty

We naturally gravitate toward ideas that confirm what we already believe. This cognitive bias, while protective, can also limit our potential for growth and understanding.

## The Value of Intellectual Discomfort

When we encounter ideas that make us uncomfortable or challenge our worldview, our first instinct is often to dismiss them. But what if we leaned into that discomfort instead?

### Questions to Ask Yourself

- What belief do I hold that I've never seriously questioned?
- What would I think if I encountered evidence that contradicted my strongest convictions?
- How might someone with completely different life experiences view this situation?

## The Practice

Try this: Once a week, actively seek out a perspective that challenges something you believe strongly. Read it with genuine curiosity rather than looking for ways to debunk it.

You don't have to change your mind, but you might discover nuances you hadn't considered before.

## Conclusion

The goal isn't to become wishy-washy or abandon all convictions. It's to hold our beliefs with both confidence and humility, knowing that growth often comes from the places that make us most uncomfortable.
