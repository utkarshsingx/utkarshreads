You get the job.  
The raise.  
The house.  

People clap. Congratulate.  
Your LinkedIn lights up like a Christmas tree.  

But you wake up the next morning  
and realize nothing inside you has changed.  

Turns out, money doesn’t erase loneliness.  
Promotions don’t hug you back.  
And success feels strangely like standing on a stage  
while the seats are empty.  

Nobody admits this out loud  
because it sounds ungrateful.  
But the silence around it is exactly why people crumble quietly  
in “perfect” lives.
