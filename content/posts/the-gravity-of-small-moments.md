We wait for lightning to strike,  
for the grand revelation,  
for the life-changing sign.  

But the universe whispers instead of shouts.  

It’s in the way sunlight bends across your kitchen table.  
The way a stranger holds the door a moment longer.  
The way your heartbeat slows  
when you finally forgive yourself.  

Not grand, not cinematic,  
but weighty all the same.  

The small moments are gravity—  
they hold us together  
when everything else feels scattered.
