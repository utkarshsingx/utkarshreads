People ask, “Have you gotten over it yet?”  
Like it’s a flu.  
Like healing is a checklist.  

You don’t get over it.  
You get around it.  
You build a life around the crater left behind.  

Yes, you’ll laugh again.  
Yes, you’ll fall in love again.  
Yes, you’ll pay bills, binge shows, scroll Instagram.  

But that doesn’t erase the night you screamed into your pillow until your throat bled.  
It doesn’t cancel the dreams that still wake you sweating.  

Healing is not deletion.  
It’s adaptation.  
You’re not the same person you were before,  
and maybe that’s the point.
