We tell ourselves we’ll do it later.  
Call them later.  
Rest later.  
Start later.  

But “later” is a lie we sell ourselves so we don’t have to face the cost of now.  

People don’t always get a later.  
I know, because I once thought I’d see my friend after “things calmed down.”  
The funeral didn’t feel like a good enough substitute.  

Here’s the cruel thing: life never calms down.  
There will always be bills.  
Deadlines.  
Traffic.  
A thousand excuses neatly disguised as obligations.  

The question isn’t “when will it be the right time?”  
The question is “how many times are you willing to gamble that later still exists?”
