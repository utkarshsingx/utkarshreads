Nobody wants to admit this:  
sometimes you’re jealous of your friends.  

You clap for their promotion,  
smile at their engagement photos,  
double-tap their vacation posts—  
and then sit in your own apartment thinking,  
“Why not me?”  

It doesn’t mean you don’t love them.  
It doesn’t mean you don’t want them happy.  
It just means you’re human.  

We’re taught jealousy makes us ugly.  
But pretending it doesn’t exist makes us dishonest.  
The truth: you can celebrate someone and ache at the same time.  
Both can live in the same body.
