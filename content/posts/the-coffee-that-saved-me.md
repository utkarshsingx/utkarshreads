Once, I sat in a café at 9 a.m.,  
pretending to check emails,  
but really just trying not to fall apart.  

The world outside kept moving—  
cars, deadlines, people with purpose.  
Inside, I stared into a cup of coffee like it might have answers.  

The barista didn’t know,  
but her small act of kindness—  
a refill I didn’t ask for,  
a soft “take your time”—  
kept me tethered to this planet that day.  

Not all rescues are dramatic.  
Sometimes they’re a quiet cup placed on a table,  
the warmth seeping into your hands  
when you’ve forgotten you still have them.
