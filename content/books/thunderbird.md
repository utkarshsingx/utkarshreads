# Thunderbird by Chuck Wendig

## My Review

Chuck Wendig delivers another gripping tale that blends science fiction with thriller elements in a way that keeps you turning pages late into the night.

## What I Loved

### The World Building
Wendig creates a believable near-future world where technology and humanity collide in unexpected ways. The attention to detail in the technological aspects never feels overwhelming or preachy.

### Character Development
The protagonist's journey from skeptic to believer feels authentic and earned. The supporting characters each have distinct voices and motivations that drive the plot forward naturally.

### Pacing
The book maintains excellent pacing throughout, with action sequences balanced by quieter character moments that allow for reflection and growth.

## Minor Criticisms

While the book is largely successful, there are a few moments where the dialogue feels slightly forced, particularly in the romantic subplot. However, these moments are brief and don't detract significantly from the overall experience.

## Final Thoughts

This is solid science fiction that doesn't sacrifice character development for spectacle. Wendig continues to prove he's one of the most reliable voices in contemporary sci-fi.

**Recommended for:** Fans of near-future sci-fi, thriller readers looking for something with more depth, and anyone who enjoyed Wendig's previous work.

## Rating: 4/5 Stars

A compelling read that successfully balances action, character development, and thought-provoking themes about technology's role in our future.
